<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, world!. My name is Roudane Imad. I was born on 28 mars 2002, and I live in Casablanca, Morocco. a coastal city in western Morocco, also known as the economic capital. Morocco, in general, is divided into 16 regions, each with its own unique cultures and traditions. This is what most of my foreign friends who have visited Morocco before say.</p>

<p>Since my childhood, I have loved science and analyzing things. I studied in the scientific stream and then specialized in physics and chemistry. However, I later changed my direction in university studies and earned a degree in biology and animal physiology; To clarify, animal physiology refers to living animals as well as humans, as they are essentially composed of animal cells.</p>

<p>Aside from academics and work, I have several hobbies. I enjoy playing chess and video games, and I also practice swimming. I love spending time with my friends; every week, we walk along the beach, and talk about our latest updates and progress, whether professionally or academically.</p>
